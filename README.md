Text-to-Image Generation: This allows you to create unique human faces simply by typing a description. The application uses a Stable Diffusion model and enhances your prompts to ensure the generated images are high-quality and detailed portraits.

Image-to-Image Age Transformation: This feature lets you upload an image of a face and then use a slider to simulate how that person might look older or younger. It works by:

Detecting faces and landmarks using Dlib to pinpoint key facial features.

Applying simulated age effects through advanced image processing techniques like blurring, sharpening, bilateral filtering, gamma correction, and subtle color shifts. These effects are dynamically adjusted based on how much older or younger you want the face to appear.

Seamlessly blending the transformed face back into the original image using OpenCV's Poisson Image Editing to ensure a natural and smooth result.
